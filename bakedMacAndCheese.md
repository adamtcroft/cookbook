## Additional Lessons
The first time making this I cut to 1.5 cups of milk and 2 cups (give or take) of cheese.  Cooked for 35 minutes, then added 10 minutes @ 375.

Bake was good, would not use any less milk.  Needed more cheese, would _definitely_ use at least 2.5 cups of cheese, and may _always_ need additional cheese to melt in at the end.
